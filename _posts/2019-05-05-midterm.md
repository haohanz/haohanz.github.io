## Virtualization
- Reasons for success of virtualization
    - Scaling system: Ability to dynamically grow resources in cloud is hard
        - e.g. “software-defined storage” virtualizes storage components
        - e.g “software-defined networking” virtualizes network components
    - Change CAPEX -> OPEX: change from capital expense to operational expense
    - Flexible allocation of resources in cloud -- “elasticity”
- Why virtualization
    - Elasticity - CAPEX->OPEX
    - Resource & failure isolation -> monitor & limit resource usage, contain failure locally.
    - Mixed-OS environment
    - Security isolation -> fully control any resource access and possible actions of tenant
- Virtualization interfaces
- Legacy world have hardware interface, the waistline is narrow and stable
    - Narrow - freer innovation, vendor neutrality
    - Stable - longevity & ubiquity

- Hardware virtualization (requirements, implementation ideas, implications)
    - Overview: fidelity, near exact
    - Thin waistline interface (see above), narrow and stable
    - Implementation
        - Create Virtualization layer, an extra level
        - of indirection, divide OS into multiple parts, 
        - Originally, os controls hardware, software tightly coupled with hardware; with virtualization layer, os and hardware are decoupled
    - Goal: fully emulate architecture
    - Requirements
        - Portability
        - Encapsulation: (Mixed-OS) capture all vm state, 
        - Isolation: resource, fault, performance, software isolation
        - Interposition: 
            - Completely control access to all system resources
            - Transformations on instructions, CPU, I/O, Memory, Disks
    - Type 1:
        - Bare/Native metal, hypervisor, os, vm are separated
        - Live migration
        - Higher performance
    - Type 2:
        - Hosted: os > hypervisor > vm > software
        - Easy to install, 
        Leverage host’s device drivers
        ○ VMware Workstation, Parallels
    - Can add significant overhead
        - Memory/Disk overhead (duplicate data)
        - I/O overhead
        - OS-startup overhead per VM
        - Hypervisor overhead


- OS-level virtualization (requirements, implementation ideas, implications)
    - Wide interface (OS interface, syscalls)
        - Brittle abstraction, os-specific, hard to secure, maintain, deploy
    - Perception: VM have too much overhead, hard to scale up.
    - Idea: 
        - Multiple isolated instances of programs (VM, programs are not isolated)
        - Running in user-space (shared kernel)
        - Instances see only resources (files, devices) assigned to their container
    - Requirements:
        - Same as VM: resource & failure isolation, encapsulation, portability
        - Diff from VM: no interposition - no hypervisor (VMM)
    - Problems:
        - Isolating which resources containers see
        - Isolating resource usage
        - Efficient per-container filesystems
    - Implementation
        - Resource view isolation (user can only see the container's resource of himself. 
            - Each process have a namespace. Container make direct syscall, security is depended on kernel.
        - Resource usage isolation - each container (have his group process) use counter- rate limit for CPU, I/O, or hard disk limit, OOM for shutting down
        - File system isolation - VM uses a virtual disk, Container don't.
            - Use two layers, one RO, one RW (for each container, ephemeral)
    - Advantage
        - Fast boot time
        - High density
        - Small I/O overhead
        - Require no CPU support
    - Container
        - Implementation difficult, large waistline - overlayfs, namespace, cgroup
        - Less general
        - Hard to migrate
        - Unsecure: large surface, container have all syscall access!
- Summary
    - VMs
        - Strengths: strong isolation guarantees, can run different Oss, VM migration practical
        - Weeknesses: OS startup, disk, memory, hypervisor overhead
    - Containers
        - Strengths: fast startup times, negligible I/O overheads, very high density
        - Weaknesses: weak security isolation

## Caching Reivew
- Lease -> \inf == call back
- Lease -> 0 == check on use
- At most once 
    - Have sequence number
    - Have duplication
    - TCP simplifies this
    - Server compute at most once
    - Client send request multiple times
    - Have a final timeout
    - Most likely to have orphans
- At least once 
    - Resend, compute, resend, compute, …., 
    - Server side is stateless
    - No duplication
    - Don’t store the computed result.

## Scaling Architectures
- What is scalability, when do we need it
    - Ability to rapidly and easily grow the system, we need load scalability - add more concurrent users
- Scale up vs scale out (comparison, implementation, performance)
    - Scala up: add resource to node
        - Easy, fast, easy to reach limit, no new failure model, latency concerns between nodes.
    - Scale out: add node
        - Rewrite, more failure model, latency concerns across node
    - Latency:
        - Load = arrive rate/service rate
- Load = avg arrive rate / avg service rate
- Avg request latency = 
load/((1−load)∗servic\_rate)
- Scale-out architectures, load balancers
    - JSQ: join shortest queue
        - stateful, hard to implement
        - Decide on the arrival time is insufficient, job may have different time to run
    - Power-of-two: random request two server
    - Central-queue LB:
        - Even better than scale up
    
    
- What is a node, scalable web services
    - Node: thread, process, vm, physical, ram…
    - Reliability: less. Easy to fail, but non state, fs use duplicate.


- Elastic Scaling
    - sources of latency, what happens under overload
      - Temporary overload
      - Persistent overload
    - options of dealing with overload
      - Live with high latency
      - Drop job
      - Scale out
    - sub-linear scaling intuition (no need to know square root formula)
    - scaling based on load signals and with cost-aware load balancers
    - challenges of o o othis approach, what is the right scaling signal

## RPC
- Motivation
- Advantages / disadvantages, limitations
- Failure independence
- DS challenges (packet loss, unpredictable delays, failures,
- Distinguishing server death from network failure/delay)
- Synchronous model
- Stubs, interfaces
- Serialization
- Reliable transport (timeouts, retransmission, duplicate elimination)
- RPC semantics and how to apply them
- Exactly-once (theoretical idea, why theoretical)
- At-most-once (practical, implementation)
- At-least-once (assumption)
- Safety and liveness properties
